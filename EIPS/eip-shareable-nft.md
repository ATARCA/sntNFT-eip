## Abstract

The following defines a standard interface for shareable non-transferable non-fungible tokens. The standard allows creation of tokens that can hold value, but cannot be exchanged for rival goods such as money, cryptocurrencies or other goods that hold monetary value. Minted tokens can be shared, or in this case re-minted, by their owners to new recipients to denote sharing of the token. The sharing and its associated events allow construction of a graph showing whom has shared what to which party.

## Motivation

- NFTs are typically rival and capture only rival value
- New types of digitital token representations are required to capture non-rival and anti-rival properties of goods
- Goal is to support ATARCA project and it's requirements to account positive externalities in its use cases and to capture and measure accumulated value

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- interface design
